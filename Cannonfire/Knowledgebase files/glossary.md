Explanation:
README.md: The main entry point for documentation. It provides an overview of the entire application and links to other documents for easy navigation.

Module Directories (physics, graphics, gameplay, ui, audio): Each module has its own directory containing its README file and other relevant resources. The README file in each module directory provides detailed documentation specific to that module.

Examples Subdirectories: Within each module directory, an 'examples' subdirectory contains sample code and test cases demonstrating how to use the module's functionality.

Assets and Design Files: For the graphics and UI modules, directories for assets (like textures and 3D models) and UI designs (like mockups) are included.

Glossary: A glossary file for defining specific terms and concepts used throughout the project, aiding in clarity and understanding.

Appendices: This directory contains additional documents like setup instructions and testing guidelines, which are important for developers but not directly part of the core documentation.
