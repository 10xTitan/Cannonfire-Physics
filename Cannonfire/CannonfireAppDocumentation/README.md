### Cannonfire App: Master Documentation Guide

#### Introduction
This document serves as the master guide for the development of the Cannonfire app. It outlines the primary objectives and provides a structured development roadmap. Utilizing the detailed documentation files in each module, an AI coding assistant will have a comprehensive knowledgebase to develop the app efficiently.

#### Objectives of Documentation
1. **Provide Clear Understanding**: Ensure the AI comprehends the core mechanics, functionalities, and goals of the Cannonfire app.
2. **Facilitate Efficient Development**: Guide the AI through a step-by-step process, focusing on key areas in a logical order.
3. **Ensure Quality and Consistency**: Maintain high standards in code quality, performance, and user experience throughout the development.

#### Development Roadmap
The development process is divided into sequential phases, each focusing on a specific aspect of the app. The AI should complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

1. **Phase 1: Setup and Initialization**
   - Objective: Set up the development environment and understand the basic structure of the app.
   - Key Focus: Review `setupInstructions.md` in the appendices.

2. **Phase 2: Physics Module**
   - Objective: Develop the physics engine, focusing on collision detection, gravity, and impact computations.
   - Key Focus: Implement features outlined in `physics/README.md` and `physics/examples/`.
   - Completion Criteria: Physics simulations are accurate and performant.

3. **Phase 3: Graphics Module**
   - Objective: Create the 3D environment, including rendering objects, applying textures, and configuring lighting.
   - Key Focus: Follow guidelines in `graphics/README.md`, `graphics/examples/`, and utilize assets in `graphics/assets/`.
   - Completion Criteria: The environment and objects are rendered with high-quality graphics.

4. **Phase 4: Gameplay Module**
   - Objective: Implement core gameplay mechanics like firing projectiles and scoring.
   - Key Focus: Develop functionalities as per `gameplay/README.md` and `gameplay/gameMechanics.md`.
   - Completion Criteria: Gameplay is engaging, interactive, and aligns with the game mechanics.

5. **Phase 5: UI Module**
   - Objective: Design and implement the user interface, including the crosshair, firing controls, and score display.
   - Key Focus: UI development as per `ui/README.md` and integration of designs from `ui/uiDesigns/`.
   - Completion Criteria: UI is intuitive, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing.

6. **Phase 6: Audio Module (Optional)**
   - Objective: Add sound effects to enhance the game experience (if applicable).
   - Key Focus: Integrate audio as described in `audio/README.md` using resources from `audio/soundEffects/`.
   - Completion Criteria: Sound effects are well-timed and add to the immersion.

7. **Phase 7: Final Integration and Testing**
   - Objective: Integrate all modules, perform comprehensive testing, and refine the app.
   - Key Focus: Follow `testingGuidelines.md` in the appendices for thorough testing.
   - Completion Criteria: The app functions seamlessly, with all components working in harmony.

#### Glossary and Cross-Referencing
The AI should regularly consult the `glossary.md` to understand specific terms and concepts. Cross-referencing between module documentation is encouraged to ensure a holistic understanding of the app's architecture.

#### Conclusion
This master documentation guide, combined with the detailed module documentation, provides a structured approach for the AI to develop the Cannonfire app. Adherence to this roadmap will ensure a focused and systematic development process, leading to a successful and high-quality application.
